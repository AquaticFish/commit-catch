# How to make a Cosmopolitan

[Cocktail cheat sheet](https://www.liquor.com/recipes/cosmopolitan/)

The legendary Cosmopolitan is a simple cocktail with a big history. It reached its height of popularity in the 1990s, when the HBO show *“Sex and the City”* was at its peak. The pink-hued, Martini-style drink was a favorite of the characters on the show. It made its debut during the second season and became a series regular after that.

For a good decade, the Cosmopolitan may have been **the most popular cocktail** in America, and bartenders couldn’t work a shift without making dozens of them for thirsty patrons. Naturally, its ubiquity spurred countless riffs, from the White Cosmo *(St-Germain in place of Cointreau)* to versions featuring gin. While the drink isn’t as popular today as it was in its heyday, the classic recipe is still very much alive.
